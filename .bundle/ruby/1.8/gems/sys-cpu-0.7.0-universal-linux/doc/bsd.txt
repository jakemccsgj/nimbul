== Constants
VERSION
   Returns the current version number for this package.
    
== Class Methods
CPU.architecture
   Returns the cpu's architecture.

CPU.freq
   Returns an integer indicating the speed (i.e. frequency in Mhz) of
   the cpu.
   
   Not supported on OS X.
    
CPU.load_avg
   Returns an array of three floats indicating the 1, 5 and 15 minute load
   average.
    
CPU.machine
   Returns the class of cpu (probably identical to the architecture).

CPU.model
   Returns a string indicating the cpu model.
    
CPU.num_cpu
   Returns an integer indicating the number of cpu's on the system.
    
== Error Classes
CPU::Error < StandardError
   Raised is response to internal function errors, usually relating to an
   invalid cpu number.
