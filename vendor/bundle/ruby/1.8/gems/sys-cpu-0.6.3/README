= Description
   A Ruby interface for getting cpu information.

= Installation
  gem install sys-cpu
  gem install sys-cpu --platform mswin32 # MS Windows

= Notes
== All Platforms
  I do not support any Ruby 1.8.x branch after 1.8.6. It should work on those
  versions of Ruby but if it breaks I'm not going to go out of my way to fix
  it. I will, however, support the 1.9.x/2.x branch.

== Solaris
  Currently there is no 'processors()' iterative method for multi-cpu systems.
  I plan to add it this in a future release.
   
== OS X
  The CPU.freq method is not supported at the moment. The sysctl() approach
  returns a bogus, hard coded value of some sort. I suspect it's possible
  by using kernel modules via kldload(), but I'm not sure how yet.

== Linux
  This is pure Ruby. This version reads information out of /proc/cpuinfo and
  /proc/loadavg, so if /proc isn't mounted it won't work.

  The key-value information in /proc/cpuinfo is stored internally (i.e. in
  memory) as an array of hashes when you first 'require' this package.  This
  overhead is exceptionally minimal, given that your average cpuinfo file
  contains less than 1k of text (and I don't store whitespace or newlines).

  The text documentation for Linux is dynamically generated during the
  build process because the fields vary depending on your setup.  So, don't
  look at it until *after* you've installed it.  You will see a doc/linux.txt
  file after you run 'rake install' (via install.rb).

== HP-UX
  Unlike other platforms, you can get load averages for an individual cpu in
  multi-cpu systems. See documentation for more details.

== MS Windows
  This is a pure Ruby implementation using the win32ole package + WMI. The C
  version has been scrapped. 

  As of version 0.5.0, the CPU.usage method has been removed in favor of the
  CPU.load_avg method.  This does not (currently) use a perf counter, so there
  is no longer any delay.  Also, the 'processors' method has been
  added and the 'supported' method has been dropped.  See the documentation
  for other changes.
   
= Acknowledgements
  Thanks go to the MPlayer team for some source code that helped me on
  certain versions of FreeBSD.

= Known Bugs
  None that I'm aware of. Please report bugs on the project page at
  http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/sysutils.

= Future Plans
  Add iterative CPU.processors method.
  Make CPU.freq work on OS X.
  Add more information in general, such as what 'prtdiag' shows.
