== Description
    Sys::CPU - An interface for various cpu statistics

== Synopsis
    require "sys/cpu"
    include Sys

    CPU.processors{ |cs|
       cs.members.each{ |m|
          puts "#{m}: " + cs[m].to_s
       }
    }

    CPU.bogomips(1) # -> returns bogomips for cpu #2

== Notes
   Portions of this documentation built dynamically

== Constants
VERSION
   Returns the current version number for this package as a String.

== Class Methods
CPU.load_avg
    Returns an array of three floats indicating the 1, 5 and 15 minute load
    average.

CPU.cpu_stats
    Returns a hash, with the cpu number as the key and an array as the value.
    The array contains the number of seconds that the system spent in
    user mode, user mode with low priority (nice), system mode, and the
    idle task, respectively, for that cpu.

CPU.processors{ |cpu struct| block }
    Calls the block for each processor on your system, passing a CPUStruct as the
    parameter.

    The exact members of the CPUStruct are the same as the class method names, except
    for CPU.processors (although you may optionally omit the "?" when referring to a
    struct member).  These were determined when you installed this package because they
    vary from one chip architecture to another.
