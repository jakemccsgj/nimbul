== DESCRIPTION:

This is a native Ruby package for reading and writing INI files.

Although made popular by Windows, INI files can be used on any system thanks
to their flexibility. They allow a program to store configuration data, which
can then be easily parsed and changed. Two notable systems that use the INI
format are Samba and Trac.
  
== SYNOPSIS:

An initialization file, or INI file, is a configuration file that contains
configuration data for Microsoft Windows based applications. Starting with
Windows 95, the INI file format was superseded but not entirely replaced by
a registry database in Microsoft operating systems.

Although made popular by Windows, INI files can be used on any system thanks
to their flexibility. They allow a program to store configuration data, which
can then be easily parsed and changed.

=== File Format

A typical INI file might look like this:

  [section1]

  ; some comment on section1
  var1 = foo
  var2 = doodle
  var3 = "multiline
  also possible"
 
  [section2]

  ; another comment
  var1 = baz
  var2 = shoodle


==== Format

This describes the elements of the INI file format:

* *Sections*: Section declarations start with '[' and end with ']' as in [section1] and [section2] above. And sections start with section declarations.
* *Parameters*: The "var1 = foo" above is an example of a parameter (also known as an item). Parameters are made up of a key ('var1'), equals sign ('='), and a value ('foo'). Multiline is support if value of parameter is enclosed by ".
* *Comments*: All the lines starting with a ';' are assumed to be comments, and are ignored.

==== Differences

The format of INI files is not well defined. Many programs interpret their
structure differently than the basic structure that was defined in the above
example. The following is a basic list of some of the differences:

* *Comments*: Programs like Samba accept either ';' or '#' as comments. Comments can be added after parameters with several formats.
* *Backslashes*: Adding a backslash '\' allows you to continue the value from one line to another. Some formats also allow various escapes with a '\', such as '\n' for newline.
* <b>Duplicate parameters</b>: Most of the time, you can't have two parameters with the same name in one section. Therefore one can say that parameters are local to the section. Although this behavior can vary between implementations, it is advisable to stick with this rule.
* <b>Duplicate sections</b>: If you have more than one section with the same name then the last section overrides the previous one. (Some implementations will merge them if they have different keys.)
* Some implementations allow ':' in place of '='.

=== This Package

This package supports the standard INI file format described in the *Format*
section above. The following differences are also supported:

* *Comments*: The comment character can be specified when an +IniFile+ is created. The comment character must be the first non-whitespace character on a line.
* *Backslashes*: Backslashes are not supported by this package. But multilines are. Enclose the param's value by ".
* <b>Duplicate parameters</b>: Duplicate parameters are allowed in a single section. The last parameter value is the one that will be stored in the +IniFile+.
* <b>Duplicate sections</b>: Duplicate sections will be merged. Parameters duplicated between to the two sections follow the duplicate parameters rule above.
* *Parameters*: The parameter separator character can be specified when an +IniFile+ is created.
